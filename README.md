# MyLeetcodeSolutions 
is a repo for the solutions i wrote for the leetcode problems, who would have guessed that. 
Its also for me or better for my futur self to see what code is was producing these days
and see how i improved by also updating the code of my past self. 
For you its seeing how i do things to solve the problems on leetcode if your stuck maybe.
